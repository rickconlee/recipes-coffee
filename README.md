Rick's Morning Coffee


This is what I do to make my coffee in the morning. There are a few items to note, since raw materials are different depending on where I am, and what I'm doing. 

Home.Canada - This is the coffee I make when I'm at Danielle and I's apartment in Canada. \
Home.New York - This is what I make when I'm at home in Upstate NY. \
Work.* - Anything I make at work, since materials are widely different than they are when I am sitting at home, wherever home happens to be.
